# Waste Classification App

## Overview

The Waste Classification App is a web application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and classify waste from five categories: plastic bottles, wood, paper, e-waste, and plastic bags. This open-source project not only helps users correctly classify their waste but also provides efficient disposal recommendations, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable environment.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: The app uses AI to analyze images of waste items, identifying them as plastic bottles, wood, paper, e-waste, or plastic bags.

- **Classification**: Once the waste item is identified, the app classifies it into one of the five categories.

- **Disposal Recommendations**: The app offers suggestions on how to efficiently dispose of the waste, including recycling options and disposal locations.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The intuitive and user-friendly interface makes it easy for users of all ages to classify waste.

- **Educational Resources**: Users can access educational materials and resources on waste management and recycling.

- **Open Source**: This project is open source, allowing developers to contribute to its improvement and expansion.
